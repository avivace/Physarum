abstract="Slime mould computers have been used to solve graph-theoretical problems like mazes and evaluate man-made transport networks. For the laboratory experiments that demonstrate these computing capabilities, slime mould is first starved and then introduced to an area with attractants placed on key positions. The behaviour of slime mould during these laboratory experiments have been simulated by a model based on cellular automata (CAs). The advantages of a software model over the real slime mould are repeatability and faster productions of results. Using CAs can be justified by the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions, a rule that applies also on the real slime mould. The results of the model have been compared to the ones produced during laboratory experiments and found in good agreement both for maze solving and network designing. After thorough examination of the laboratory experiments an updated model was developed, which yielded more efficient networks. As the model was parametrized to produce slightly differentiated results, the effects of these parameters were studied.",

abstract = "We describe here a mathematical model of the adaptive dynamics of a transport network of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, an amoeboid organism that exhibits path-finding behavior in a maze. This organism possesses a network of tubular elements, by means of which nutrients and signals circulate through the plasmodium. When the organism is put in a maze, the network changes its shape to connect two exits by the shortest path. This process of path-finding is attributed to an underlying physiological mechanism: a tube thickens as the flux through it increases. The experimental evidence for this is, however, only qualitative. We constructed a mathematical model of the general form of the tube dynamics. Our model contains a key parameter corresponding to the extent of the feedback regulation between the thickness of a tube and the flux through it. We demonstrate the dependence of the behavior of the model on this parameter."

	abstract = {Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks{\textemdash}in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},
