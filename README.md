# Physarum

## Develop

Clone the project locally: `git clone git@github.com:avivace/Physarum.git`

### Unity

Be sure you are on Unity 2018.3.14f1 (64-bit). For some reasons, the WebGL build doesn't work on Linux.

**Unity** -> **Open Project** -> **Select the "UnityProject"** folder inside the cloned repository. Once the project import finished, drag and drop the "SampleScene" from the assets folder (Project Pane) into the Hyerarchy pane. Double click on "SampleScene" then you can run the project (Play).

### Web UI application
